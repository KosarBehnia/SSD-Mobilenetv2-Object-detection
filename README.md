Object Detection in Videos and pictures using TensorFlow

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to perform object detection in videos using TensorFlow. The script uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to detect objects in each frame of a video and draws bounding boxes around the detected objects.
Installation

To run this script, you need to install the following dependencies:

    TensorFlow: Follow the instructions on the TensorFlow website ↗ to install TensorFlow on your system.
    OpenCV: Follow the instructions on the OpenCV website ↗ to install OpenCV on your system.

Sure, here's an example of a README file for a GitHub repository that presents a Python script for object detection in videos using TensorFlow:

# Object Detection in Videos using TensorFlow

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to perform object detection in videos using TensorFlow. The script uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to detect objects in each frame of a video and draws bounding boxes around the detected objects.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to install the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow: Follow the instructions on the [TensorFlow website ↗](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) to install TensorFlow on your system.
- OpenCV: Follow the instructions on the [OpenCV website ↗](https://opencv.org/) to install OpenCV on your system.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `object_detection_video.py` file.
3. Run the following command to detect objects in a video file:

   `````
   python object_detection_video.py --input <path_to_input_video> --output <path_to_output_video>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_input_video>` with the path to the input video file and `<path_to_output_video>` with the desired path for the output video file.
   
   Optionally, you can also specify a detection threshold using the `--threshold` argument. For example, to set the detection threshold to 0.5, run the following command:

   ````
   python object_detection_video.py --input <path_to_input_video> --output <path_to_output_video> --threshold 0.5
   ````

   The default detection threshold is 0.5.
   
   Note: This script has been tested with MP4 video files on Windows and Linux systems. Other video formats may not be compatible.

## Acknowledgements

This script is based on the [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and uses a pre-trained [SSD MobileNet V2](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md#mobile-models) model for object detection. The `label_map.pbtxt` file used in this script is based on the [MS COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/).
